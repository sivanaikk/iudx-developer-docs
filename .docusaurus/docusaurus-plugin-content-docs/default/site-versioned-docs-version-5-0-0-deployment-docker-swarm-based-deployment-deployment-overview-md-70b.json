  "description": "IUDX platform can be deployed in Docker Swarm using the scripts and Swarm code present in this directory and sub-directories. Each component is deployed as a single instance in Swarm. The components can be scaled manually. IUDX platform exposes endpoints through two ports - one for HTTPS traffic which it passes to Nginx and Nginx routes to the appropriate service; one for Rabbitmq management and AMQPS streaming. The whole system is monitored using a monitoring stack module - Prometheus for metrics, promtail and Loki for logs, and Grafana for visualization and alerting. The overall architecture of Swarm deployment is summarized in the figure below.",
