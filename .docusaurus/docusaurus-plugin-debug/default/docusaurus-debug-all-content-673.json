Each component is deployed as a single instance in Swarm. The components can be scaled manually. IUDX platform exposes endpoints through two ports - one for HTTPS traffic which it passes to Nginx and Nginx routes to the appropriate service; another for Rabbitmq management and AMQPS streaming. The whole system is monitored using a monitoring stack module - Prometheus for metrics, promtail and Loki for logs, and Grafana for visualization and alerting. The overall architecture of Swarm deployment is summarized in the figure below.",

The whole system is monitored using a monitoring stack module - Prometheus for metrics, promtail and Loki for logs, and Grafana for visualization and alerting.

The whole system is monitored using a monitoring stack module - Prometheus for metrics, promtail and Loki for logs, and Grafana for visualization and alerting.
